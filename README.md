# HowBitterIsTheBeer
This analysis explores key beer characteristics, such as alcohol by volume (ABV), beer color (SRM), and original gravity, to uncover their relationships with IBU and optimize predictive accuracy.

This project analyzes a dataset of 6,000 beer observations to investigate predictors of bitterness, measured in IBUs. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data visualization, correlation analysis, and multicollinearity checks. Linear regression models, including stepwise selection, are used to identify the best combination of predictors for IBU, with findings suggesting opportunities for further improvements.
